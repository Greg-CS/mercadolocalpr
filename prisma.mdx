Sure, here's a basic guide to using Prisma ORM in an MDX file:

# Prisma ORM Guide

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit. It replaces traditional ORMs and makes database access easy with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your database schema.

## Installation

First, install the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev

Then, initialize Prisma in your project:

npx prisma init

This command creates a new prisma directory in your project with two files:

schema.prisma: This is the Prisma schema file. It contains your database connection and the Prisma Client generator.
.env: This is a dotenv file for defining environment variables.
Define Your Database Schema
In the schema.prisma file, you define your database schema, i.e., the models that represent your database tables.

Here's an example of how you can define a User model:

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

Generate Prisma Client
After defining your database schema, you can generate Prisma Client:

Prisma Client is a type-safe database client that's generated from your Prisma schema.

Use Prisma Client in Your Code
You can now use Prisma Client in your code to send queries to your database. Here's an example of how you can create a new user:

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  })

  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })

In this example, prisma.user.create is used to create a new user in the database.

That's it! You're now ready to use Prisma ORM in your project.

```
